    \toprule
    \textbf{Variable}
     & \textbf{Description}
    \\ \midrule
    $\kappa$
     & Security parameter; length of the random oracle output.
    \\ \midrule
    $T$
     & The target to successful solve a PoW.
    \\ \midrule
    $m$
     & The size of enclave public key that clients should encrypt to; $m = \Theta(\log^2 \kappa)$.
    \\ \midrule
    \CPLen
     & The common prefix parameter; $\CPLen = \Theta(\log^2 \kappa)$. When clients issue a transaction \tx, they associate \tx with the block on the tip of \chainPrefix{\chainLocal}{\CPLen}.
    \\ \midrule
    $R$
     & The recency parameter of profile blocks.
    \\ \midrule
    \PBWindowLen
     & The size of a window that is used to decide transaction timestamp, counted by the number of blocks.
    \\ \midrule
    $h_r$
     & Number of RO queries made by honest parties at round $r$.
    \\ \midrule
    $t_r$
     & Number of RO queries made by corrupted parties at round $r$.
    \\ \midrule
    $\delta$
     & Advantage of honest parties $(t \le (1 - \delta) h)$.
    \\ \midrule
    $f$
     & Block generation rate; the probability at least one honest party succeeds in finding a PoW in a round.

        \item Upon receiving $(\textsc{diffuse}, \sid, (\chain_{i_1}, U_{i_1}), \ldots, (\chain_{i_\ell}, U_{i_\ell}))$ with a list of chains and corresponding parties from \adv (or on behalf some corrupted $\party \in \partyset$), then do the following:
        %
        \begin{cccEnum}[nosep]
            \item Relay this input to the simulate network functionality and record its response to \adv.
            \item Execute $\textsc{ExtendLedgerState}(\ledgerTime)$.

        \item Upon receiving $(\textsc{fetch}, \sid)$ from \adv on behalf some corrupted $\party \in \partyset$ forward the request to the simulated $\funcDiffuse^{\mathsf{bc}}$ and return whatever is returned to \adv.

        \item Upon receiving $(\textsc{delays}, \sid, (T_{\msgid_{i_1}}, \msgid_{i_1}), \ldots, (T_{\msgid_{i_\ell}}, \msgid_{i_\ell}))$ from \adv forward the request to the simulated $\funcDiffuse^{\mathsf{bc}}$ and record the answer to \adv.
        %
        Before giving this answer to \adv, query the ledger state \state and execute $\textsc{AdjustView}(\state, \ledgerTime)$.
